# Runner 

We provide a number of experiment runners useful for different use cases of training and evaluating reinforcement learning agents. 

## Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SARL)

This runner uses Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning. In this regime, a single agent is trained. 

## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

This runner uses Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. In this regime, two independent agents are trained. 

## Evolutionary Strategies (ES)

This runner uses Evolutionary Strategies. In this regime, two independent agents are trained. 

## Evaluation 

This runner is used for evaluation. In this regime, a single, pre-trained agent is evaluated.
