Pax is an experiment platform for multi-agent shaping research built on top of JAX. It provides support for other-agent shaping and single/multi-agent reinforcement learning experiments with matrix/2D **environments**, regular/meta-learning **agents**, and evolutionary/RL-based optimisation **runners**. 

> *Pax (noun) - a period of peace that has been forced on a large area, such as an empire or even the whole world*
